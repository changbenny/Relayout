# Relayout
Relayout is a layout engine implemented in JavaScript. You can use Relayout to implement Flexbox, Grid, or any custom DOM layout.
The idea is inspired by [layout part of React-future](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/04%20-%20Layout/prototype) and [the Talk by Ben Alpert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RJf2jYzs8A).

This project is WIP, you can see the example in `index.html` file.
## Future Application
1. Custom layout components (Card layout, Flow layout, etc.)
2. On screen rendering: Relayout can make library know which parts of DOM are currently displayed in the screen and need to be updated immediately when needed.
3. Rendering optimization
